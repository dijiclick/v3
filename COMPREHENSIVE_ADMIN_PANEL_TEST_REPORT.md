### Test Execution Status

⚠️ **Automated Test Execution Limitation:**
- Playwright tests could not be executed in the Replit environment due to system dependency requirements
- The environment lacks required browser dependencies (libglib2.0, libnspr4, libnss3, etc.)
- Test files are complete and ready for execution in a proper testing environment

## Architecture Analysis

### Strengths Identified:
1. **Well-structured authentication system** with proper security measures
2. **Comprehensive bilingual support** with RTL/LTR handling
